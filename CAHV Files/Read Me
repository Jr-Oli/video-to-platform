This folder contains all the CAHV files created by Voodoo 1.2.0 after processing multiple image sequences.
Each file in a set of image sequences have x,y,z coordinates relative to one another. The coordinates in one set
are not set relative to coordinates in another set.

The Ruby file pulls only the Cx,Cy, and Cz, coordinates from each frame###.cam file and puts them into a new file
called frameCoords.txt

The pdf is a short tutorial of how to process the image sequence in Voodoo and then use the Ruby program.

The Excel file contains the coordinates from the frameCoords.txt file after they have been processed so the coordinates transition 
between sets.
